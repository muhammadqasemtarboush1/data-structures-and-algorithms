# Singly Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure, in which the elements are not stored at contiguous memory locations.
## Challenge
### Challenge Type: New Implementation
### Features:
- Node.
- Linked List
  - insert
  - include
  - to string
- Testing

## Approach & Efficiency
Singly Linked List.
Big O:

Time complexity:
 - insert : (1)
 - include : (n)
 - to string : (n)

Space complexity:
 - insert: (n)
 - include: (1)
 - to string : (1)

## API
<!-- Description of each method publicly available to your Linked List -->
> Insert:
> >Take a value and insert it into the first node 
> >return None
> 
> include: 
> > Take a value and search in the linked list if exists return True 
> > else : return False
> 
> To string:
>> return a collection of all the values that exist in the linked list
